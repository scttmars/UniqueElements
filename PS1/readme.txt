5a. The time complexity for my algorithm would be O(n^2). 
The worst case scenario would be n^2. Best case scenario for this
algorithm is O(4). The average case would be O(n^2) especially as the cases
get larger. The data does not seem to show this. The data seems to show a more
linear increase which I was surprised to discover. 
5b.If we know the range then we first check to make sure the array is not 
larger than this range. Since if an array is larger than the range it 
cannot be unique.
